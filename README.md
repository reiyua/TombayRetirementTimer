This is a simple retirement timer created for my father in a web app using REACT.js with create-react-app.

Count's down to user's specified date.

This was initally created on a repository hosted by my father, but GitHub pages had issues, so we decided to use Google Firebase Hosting to host the site, hence the fork of the repository.
