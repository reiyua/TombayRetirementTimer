This is a simple retirement timer created for my father in a web app using REACT.js with create-react-app.

This is now archivded and no longer maintained due to create-react-app being deprecated.

Moving the project to https://github.com/reiyua/TombayRetirementTimerV2

Count's down to user's specified date.
